# SPA Vanilla JS

I did this project as a hobby. I wanted to do something with javascript vanilla.

- The data is selected through the [API PUNK](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2), from which one of the pages with a certain item number is extracted. The same asynchronous function is also used to obtain the properties of a specific item. 🕵️‍♂️

- I also added a small route manager.🛰

- In the styles: use bootstrap for the grid and css for the other properties.🖼
